                <p>The repeated assessment of mental health in pandemics (RAMP) study is a multi-disciplinary, collaborative study aiming to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of people across the UK. Efforts to control the spread of the pandemic have led to drastic behaviour and routine changes as individuals are encouraged to self-isolate, work from home and implement vigilant self-hygiene.</p>
                <p>We don’t yet know what effect this new situation will have on how people think, feel and act or the impact on our households, health and lifestyle. With RAMP, we will monitor the mental health and wellbeing of people across the UK during this pandemic and try to understand the impact of COVID-19 so that we can better support people in the future.</p>
                <p><strong>You must be a resident of England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland and be over the age of 16 to participate in this study. 
            </strong></p>
                <p><strong>You will be asked a series of different questions about your health, wellbeing and mental health. We will send follow up surveys every two weeks and might send very short questions after any major government announcement. 
            </strong></p>
                <p>If you're eligible to participate, you can <strong><a class="content-link" target=_blank href=https://kcliop.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bl5GXy6nUr22beB>take part here</strong></a>.

                <p>RAMP is a collaborative effort led by a research team at King’s College London, in consultation with expert clinicians, service users, mental health charities and the NIHR bioresource. We have received financial support from King’s Together and kind donations of time and effort from a wealth of people as we have developed this tool.</p>

                    <p><strong>Who can take part?</strong></p>
                    <p>The RAMP Study is recruiting nationally, and you can participate as long as you are a resident of England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland and are over the age of 16. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="resource-item">
                    <p><strong>What is involved?</strong></p>
                    <p>After a longer baseline assessment, we will send follow up surveys every two weeks and might send very short questions after any major government announcement. The survey covers a lot of different questions about your health, wellbeing and mental health. We appreciate this can take time to complete, but hope for your help in understanding the impact of this and any future pandemics on the mental health of our communities.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="resource-item">
                    <p><strong>How long will it take me?</strong></p>
                    <p>You should set aside about 35-40 minutes for the baseline questionnaire, and about 15 minutes for the follow up questionnaires every 2-weeks, although for most people it will be shorter.

                <div class="resource-item">
                    <p><strong>Will the surveys be this long every time?</strong></p>
                    <p>No, the very first questionnaire is the longest. All of our follow up questionnaires will be about half the time.</p>
                </div>

                    <p><strong>Do I  have to do it all in one go?</strong></p>
                    <p>No. You can leave the question and come back to it after a short break.<strong> But you do need to return to the questionnaire using the same browser (e.g. chrome, opened using the same computer or device).</strong></p>

                <div class="resource-item">
                    <p><strong>Why should I take part?</strong></p>
                    <p>By taking part you will be helping us track the impact of this pandemic on our mental health and wellbeing so that we can understand what helps and what is harmful and how to react to protect individuals and communities during pandemics. </p>

                    <p>We are going to ask you to answer questions about yourself, your health, your education or employment, your feelings about and during the pandemic and your mental health before and during the pandemic. We will also ask you some questions about your physical and neurological health that might be important factors in how you are feeling. </p>
                    <p>We are also interested in the things that you are doing that you are finding positive or helpful during this time, as we hope to identify and share those things that seem to help.</p>
