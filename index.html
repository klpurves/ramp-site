                <p class="center-text">Take part in regular surveys and help us research the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and wellbeing of people all across the UK.</p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">ABOUT THE STUDY</h2>
                <p>The Repeated Assessment of Mental health in Pandemics (RAMP) study is a research project assessing the effect of COVID-19 on the mental health and wellbeing of the population. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many of us have undergone major changes to our daily lives, such as staying away from friends and family, and limiting time outside of our homes.</p>
                <p>We don’t yet know what effect this new situation will have on how we all think, feel and act or the impact on our households, health and lifestyle. With RAMP,  we will monitor the mental health and wellbeing of people across the UK during this pandemic and try to understand the impact of COVID-19 so that we can better support people in the future.</p>
                <p><strong>You must be a resident of England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland and be over the age of 16 to participate in this study. 
            </strong></p>
                <p><strong>When you sign up, you will be asked a series of different questions about your current living situation, your wellbeing and your mental and physical health. We will then send shorter follow up surveys every two weeks and may also send very short questionnaires after major government announcements. 
            </strong></p>

                <div class="resource-item">
                    <p><strong>Who can take part?</strong></p>
                    <p>The RAMP Study is recruiting nationally, and you can participate as long as you are a resident of England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland and are over the age of 16. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="resource-item">
                    <p><strong>What is involved?</strong></p>
                    <p>After a longer baseline assessment, we will send follow up surveys every two weeks and might send very short questions after any major government announcement. If any of the questions make you feel uncomfortable you can leave them out. </p>
                    <p>The survey covers a lot of different questions about your living situation, your wellbeing and mental health. We appreciate this can take time to complete, but with your help we hope to better understand the impact of this and any future pandemics on the mental health of our communities.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="resource-item">
                    <p><strong>How long will it take me?</strong></p>
                    <p>You should set aside about 35-40 minutes for the baseline questionnaire, and about 15 minutes for the follow up questionnaires every 2-weeks, although for most people it will be shorter.
                    </p>

                <div class="resource-item">
                    <p><strong>Will the surveys be this long every time?</strong></p>
                    <p>No, the very first questionnaire is the longest. All of our follow up questionnaires will be about half the time.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="resource-item">
                    <p><strong>Do I  have to do it all in one go?</strong></p>
                    <p>No. You can leave the question and come back to it after a break.<strong>However, you do need to return to the questionnaire using the same browser (e.g. chrome), and it also needs to be done using the same computer or device as before.</strong></p>

                <div class="resource-item">
                    <p><strong>Why should I take part?</strong></p>
                    <p>Your participation will help us track the impact that this pandemic is having on mental health and wellbeing. This will help us work our how to react to help and support individuals and communities.</p>

                <div class="resource-item">
                    <p><strong>What sort of things will I be asked about?</strong></p>
                    <p>We are going to ask you to answer questions about yourself, your health, your education/employment, your feelings and your mental health before and during the pandemic. We will also ask you some questions about your physical health that may be important factors in how you are feeling.</p>
                    <p>We are also interested in the things that you are doing that you are finding positive or helpful during this time, as we hope to identify and share those things that seem to help.</p>
